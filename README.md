# Intercore_communication_synchronization
Intercore communication between cores on Ultrazed, each using own FreeRTOS instance. This code demonstrates the possibilities of adapting FreeRTOS for multicore platforms, with a focus on multitasking, task scheduling and problems of synchronization. Operating system FreeRTOS has been adapted to run on quad-core ARM Cortex-A53. The operating system instances run independently on each core and communicate using message queues located in shared memory. In order to avoid problems during use of shared resources, it is necessary to ensure mutual exclusion. Semaphores are used to provide mutual exclusion using Peterson algorithm for two cores and Lamport algorithm for multicore. Test examples show capabilities of communication and synchronization between cores.

Peterson directories are used for 2 core communication using Peterson algorithm. Generalization directories are used for N core communication using Lamport algorithm which is generalization of Peterson algorithm. Each core has its own bsp directory. Project consist of main program which tests the communication and synchronization between cores. Sysinit, smphr.c and queue_fifo.c are files for libmetal initialization semaphores and queues used for synchronization.
